          <h2>Android Wear 1.0 is pretty disappointing</h2>
          <p>I've had the Moto 360 Sport for just over a year, only found this out recently when I tried to get my battery repaired by Motonovo.  They kindly offered to charge me for the Service because I was around 2-3 days over the Limited Warranty - I politely refused, and then forked out Â£30 for an administration fee!  So now I'm stuck with a laggy semi-useful smartwatch, that occasionally dies at 10-15 percent.</p>

                         <br><h2>If you're like me, you've been waiting for what feels a lifetime</h2>
          <p>Android Wear 2.0 could save the platform, it feels like the hype was long lived - with the arrival of the Apple Watches, Google finally had the competition it needed... Samsungs watches weren't all that exciting for many.  I'm glad Google is taking its time with Android Wear, but I really wish my Moto 360 Sport was giving me a better experience.  I commute to work and back on a Bike, and I like to keep track of my Stats; My average Speed, how long it takes me to get to work and back each day. I find myself forgetting to switch on an Bike ride Activity each morning, or for some reason my taps weren't registered.  I only find out when I arrive at my destination.  Now this can be put down to my incompentance or it could be down to Android Wear 1.0, to activate the activity I have to Swipe left twice, then scroll all the way down to the middle of the list to 'Start a Bike Ride'.  Now if I could pin this to the Top as its my most frequently used Activity, it would be alot simpler to get to.</p>
          <h2>Android Wear 2.0 updates will start rolling out in March</h2>
          <p>Fossil has confirmed that they will be rolling out the Android Wear 2.0 update to their watches in March!  This gives owners like myself a little more confidence that the OS is coming to our watches very soon.  I, along with many others were patiently waiting for the Update, when the Developer Preview was first announced.  I was very disappointed that it didn't come sooner. Check out the Tweet below for confirmation...</p>
