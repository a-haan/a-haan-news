        <h2>My First Impressions of the Vive...</h2>

        <p>My first experience with the HTC Vive was great and I definitely don’t want it to be the last, I found the headset to be comfortable.   My first thought was that it was going to be a little heavy on the head as it did come across as quite a chunky piece of kit, but I think being immersed into the game world makes you forget about it all!  The wires did become noticeable when watching others playing with it wrapping around their feet, so be careful not to trip! You do require a lot of room (and high ceiling space), this is of course recommended as you don’t realise how much you move around the room when playing. The sensors can be adjusted to your height to track your positions as your move around the room.  I’m only 5’4 inches tall, the headset had to be adjusted for me otherwise everything in VR would be too close to ‘touch’.</p>

        <h2>I felt completely Immersed in the VR World</h2>

        <p> I found the controllers which are used to interact with the VR world, felt as though it was almost real, adding to the experience.  However I felt it could use some built in headphones as I had to wear some separately, adding to the wire issues but you could use a wireless headset, I guess that is a better solution. I think the MSI’s VR backpack would be a good investment to combat tangling wire issue and allow you to move more freely, it's been ‘debuted’ as one of the lightest VR backpacks at weighing at 3.6KG.  It would also benefit if playing with another person (not many VR Games have multiplayer yet). I have read a little about the XMG Walker which is pretty much a mobile computer on your back but I imagine this would come with a hefty price.</p>

        <h2>Games for Vive are few and far between, but they're very promising</h2>

        <p>The first game I played was ‘The Lab’ on steam, it's a good game to learn how to the controllers work, but then again on each game the controls are used in different ways.The Longbow ‘Pocket Universe’ in which you use archery to defend a castle gate from attackers was my favorite Game to play as the pace increased on each wave. I tested this on the Nvidia GTX-970 and also on the Nvidia GTX-1070 which both performed equally well. I wouldn't say it’s a highly detailed game, but all in all, a highly enjoyable Game.  I think that sums up most of the Games you can play with the HTC Vive, not many are ultra realistic some of them are plain cartoony.  Until we see Games such as Biohazard 7 supporting the HTC Vive.</p>
