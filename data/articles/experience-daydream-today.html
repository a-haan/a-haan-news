          <p>Google released the touted Daydream VR headset back in November 2016, they first debued the technology at Google I/O.  We've now had a chance to fully experience VR as Google intended.  The ecosystem for VR apps is still in its infancy, but least we can see now that there is a good amount of quality control going into Playstore.  No more are the days that any kind of riff raff would make it into the Playstore, directed at VR.  All Daydream apps have to meet specific requirements, such as support for the Daydream remote - this has a touchpad and menu buttons with a built accelerometer. </p>
          <p>The Headset itself is mostly comfortable, except for the strap that goes on the back of your head.  I wore it for atleast 2 hours once and my head was feeling awful afterwards.  This was probably due to the tightness of the headset, that you need - otherwise the headset slips and the image you see becomes blurry.</p>

          <p>If you've ever tried Apps on the Google Cardboard, you may have found the experience to be lacking - technically it works very well VR but any kind of interaction is limited to tapping a button and moving your head to aim.  This works in practice very well for maybe the first 10 minutes, but then you run into the problem of not being able to do much more than pointing and clicking.  This is what the Daydream VR shines, not only can you point and click in Virtual reality.  The remote acts as your hand - not as advanced as the HTC Vive or Oculus but, for the money I'd say you get more bang for buck!  I reviewed a few apps on Youtube, check them out below:</p>
