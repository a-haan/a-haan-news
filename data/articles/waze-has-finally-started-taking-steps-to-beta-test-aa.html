          <h2>Waze for Android Auto is highly anticipated among the Android Auto Community</h2>
<p>Google first announced that Waze is coming to Android Auto back in May 2016, almost a year later Waze is sending out Emails to Beta Testers to gauge the communities interest. Now at this point, I'm thinking that Google loves keeping us on our toes - to the point that we either give up waiting completely, forget about it entirely or go absolutely ape shit on any forum you can!  I have to say I haven't stopped wanting Waze for Android Auto, I find my self switching between the two fairly often - my daily usage is Android Auto, but when I need to get somewhere quick or I know that there's going to be lots of traffic (which is pretty much everyday here in Bristol, UK) I use Waze.  It's obvious for me that if Waze is available, I would be using that all the time!  It's not just Alerts of speed camera's nearby that draws me to Waze, it's the aggressive route diversions that I yearn for.</p>
