          <h2>Android TV is still alive!!</h2>
          <p>The Nexus Player has long been discontinued, now Google is ready to make way for a new Android TV device!  I can't say how many threads I've read on Google+ or Reddit that said "Google has abandoned the Android TV platform" I have to say, I was kinda feeling they had too.  That's until Google annouced along side Nvidia that they're planning to roll out Google Assistant to all Android TV devices, that run Android Marshmallow.  Which I for one did not expect at all, well done to Google for successfully breaking me down and then building me back up.</p>
          <br>
          <div style="float: left; padding: 15px 15px 15px 15px;"> <TABLE WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right><TR><TD>
           <news-gpt-ad id="article4"
                 ad-unit-path="/21615022194/topright"
                 ad-width="300" ad-height="250"></news-gpt-ad>
         </TD></TR></TABLE></div>
                <br><h2>Take this with a pinch of salt...</h2>
          <p>The rumours are that the new Android TV devices will support Google Assistanct out of the Box, not sure if they'll hold the Title of Pixel or Nexus - My money is on Pixel being the name, Google wants to concrete their Pixel brand as much as they can at this point, and they should!  The Device will most likely support 4K resolution TV's just like the Nvidia Shield and the Xiaomi Mi box.</p>
          <h2>The release date is rumoured to be this Spring</h2>
          <p>Google doesn't seem to be in such a rush to release a new device, I'm counting on the release of the Pixel Android TV device coinciding the release of the roll out of Google Assistant on Android TV, so far the release has been held back even on the Nvidia Shield, that it was first announced with.  Be sure to catch a review on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ahaan22">Youtube Channel</a> as soon as its ready!</p>
